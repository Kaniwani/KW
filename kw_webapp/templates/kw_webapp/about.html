            <h1>KaniWani</h1>
            <p> Is a companion website to <a href="http://www.wanikani.com">WaniKani</a>, an SRS tool for kanji and vocabulary memorization. I found that WaniKani helped a lot with being able to recognize and read Kanji, but really didn't help that much in trying to recall words without the visual stimulation of the Kanji. KaniWani attempts to bridge that gap by using your WaniKani information and force you to do the opposite of what you normally do. </p>
